### Hi!

I'm Ruth, a Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford University combining technical and social science expertise to shape technology and policy. My research focuses on AI governance and how we can use technology to promote the social good.

I combine insights from psychology, political science and computer science, and I use computational and experimental methods to analyze large-scale datasets. I am particularly passionate about preventing the spread of misinformation and election interference, promoting wellbeing and mental health, and addressing ethical challenges related to technologies such as social media and large language models.

üîç My current research includes
- measuring the reach of influence campaigns on Facebook and Instagram during the 2020 US elections (part of the [Facebook and Instagram Election Study](https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2023/july/2020-election-studies-reveals-power-of-facebook--instagram-algor.html))
- [designing and evaluating an online game to combat vaccine misinformation](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/ek5pu)
- a large-scale evaluation of misinformation interventions on Facebook
- evaluating content moderation preferences for large language models

üìö My published research addresses
- [how partisanship affects content moderation preferences](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg6799)
