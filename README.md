### Hi!

I'm Ruth, a PhD Candidate at Stanford University who combines insights and methods from psychology, political science and computer science to develop and evaluate evidence-based interventions to promote the social good.

I am particularly passionate about preventing the spread of misinformation and election interference, promoting wellbeing and mental health, and addressing ethical challenges related to technologies such as social media and large language models. 

üîç My current research includes
- measuring the reach of influence campaigns on Facebook and Instagram during the 2020 US elections (part of the [Facebook and Instagram Election Study](https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2023/july/2020-election-studies-reveals-power-of-facebook--instagram-algor.html))
- [designing and evaluating an online game to combat vaccine misinformation](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/ek5pu)
- a large-scale evaluation of misinformation interventions on Facebook
- evaluating content moderation preferences for large language models

üìö My published research addresses
- [how partisanship affects content moderation preferences](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg6799)
- the ethics and [privacy implications of new technologies](https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819200-9.00015-6)
